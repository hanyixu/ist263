<h1>Schine Student Center: What you need to know</h1>
<p><strong>FEBRUARY 10, 2021</strong></p>
<p>It's here! Our newly renovated student center is open, and there's so much to explore. Before you check it out,
    there's a lot of information that you should know. To help, we've pulled what we think are the top 4 things. For the
    full information, visit the Student Centers and Programming Services (SCPS) website and their COVID-19
    Guidelines.</p>
<h2>1. What's in Schine></h2>
<p>Some of us might remember what Schine was like before construction (and COVID). Now it’s something completely new!
    Here’s what you can find in Schine:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Intercultural Collective, a collocated space for the Disability Cultural Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and
        Office of Multicultural Affairs.
    <li>The Office of Student Activities with dedicated and functional work space for registered student organizations.
    <li>Schine Dining with brand new food options to try, including CoreLife Eatery, Panda Express and The Halal Shack.
    <li>Campus Store (formerly the Bookstore)
</ul>
